# Qt Advanced Docking System (OCS Fork)
This is the stripped down and tweaked version of Qt Advanced Docking System.
Mainly intended for usage in OCS Software, but you do you.

List of changes:
* removed unnecessary files from the repository (examples, python bindings and etc.)
* removed default SVG icons (you need to provide the icons yourself using IconProvider API)
* removed qmake support
* removed src/ads.qrc (because we don't need to package the SVG icons anymore)
* removed default .css stylesheets (you need to provide your custom stylesheet instead)
* minor layout tweaks
